# A Flutter Weather App project.

- This weather app is a user-friendly mobile application built using Flutter that provides
                                real-time weather information for any given location. It leverages the OpenWeatherMap
                                API to retrieve accurate weather data, including temperature, description, humidity,
                                feels-like temperature, and wind speed.
